# Notes in C Language

Scratch  say (hello, world)

```C
printf("hello, world\n");
```

All printed words are called strings ans strings are enclosed by "string" <br>
\n tells computer to start a new line <br>
The ; is like the period at the end of a sentence. It tells the computer that it's the end of a statement.

Scratch: set counter to 0

```C
int counter = 0;
```

In C, you must declare the type of vaiable you are creating

Scratch: change counter by 1

```C
counter = counter + 1; // add any number to counter
counter += 1; // add any number to counter
counter++; // only add +1 to counter
```

= does not mean "equal" it means "assign" or "get" <br>
Once created the variable, you don't need to repeat it ex. "int"

if x < y
{
  printf("x is less than y\n");
}
else
{
  printf("x is not less than y\n");
}
else if (x = = y)
{
  printf("x is equal to y\n");
}
